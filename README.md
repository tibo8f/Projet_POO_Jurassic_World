# Object-Oriented Game Development
In this project, we developed a game featuring a map populated by dinosaurs—some carnivores and others herbivores—as well as plants. Herbivores feed on the plants, while carnivores hunt the herbivores. Animals die if they don't eat enough within a certain time period. Players can observe the interactions between these creatures. The main goal of the project was to apply object-oriented programming principles. We implemented the project using Python.
